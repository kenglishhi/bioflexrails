      <h1>Paperclip</h1>
<p>
Paperclip is intended as an easy file attachment library for ActiveRecord.
The intent behind it was to keep setup as easy as possible and to treat
files as much like other attributes as possible. This means they
aren&#8216;t saved to their final locations on disk, nor are they deleted
if set to nil, until ActiveRecord::Base#save is called. It manages
validations based on size and presence, if required. It can transform its
assigned image into thumbnails if needed, and the prerequisites are as
simple as installing ImageMagick (which, for most modern Unix-based
systems, is as easy as installing the right packages). Attached files are
saved to the filesystem and referenced in the browser by an easily
understandable specification, which has sensible and useful defaults.
</p>
<p>
See the documentation for <tt>has_attached_file</tt> in
Paperclip::ClassMethods for more detailed options.
</p>
<h2>Quick Start</h2>
<p>
In your model:
</p>
<pre>
  class User &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
    has_attached_file :avatar, :styles =&gt; { :medium =&gt; &quot;300x300&gt;&quot;, :thumb =&gt; &quot;100x100&gt;&quot; }
  end
</pre>
<p>
In your migrations:
</p>
<pre>
  class AddAvatarColumnsToUser &lt; ActiveRecord::Migration
    def self.up
      add_column :users, :avatar_file_name,    :string
      add_column :users, :avatar_content_type, :string
      add_column :users, :avatar_file_size,    :integer
      add_column :users, :avatar_updated_at,   :datetime
    end

    def self.down
      remove_column :users, :avatar_file_name
      remove_column :users, :avatar_content_type
      remove_column :users, :avatar_file_size
      remove_column :users, :avatar_updated_at
    end
  end
</pre>
<p>
In your edit and new views:
</p>
<pre>
  &lt;% form_for :user, @user, :url =&gt; user_path, :html =&gt; { :multipart =&gt; true } do |form| %&gt;
    &lt;%= form.file_field :avatar %&gt;
  &lt;% end %&gt;
</pre>
<p>
In your controller:
</p>
<pre>
  def create
    @user = User.create( params[:user] )
  end
</pre>
<p>
In your show view:
</p>
<pre>
  &lt;%= image_tag @user.avatar.url %&gt;
  &lt;%= image_tag @user.avatar.url(:medium) %&gt;
  &lt;%= image_tag @user.avatar.url(:thumb) %&gt;
</pre>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>
The basics of paperclip are quite simple: Declare that your model has an
attachment with the has_attached_file method, and give it a name. Paperclip
will wrap up up to four attributes (all prefixed with that
attachment&#8216;s name, so you can have multiple attachments per model if
you wish) and give the a friendly front end. The attributes are
&lt;attachment&gt;_file_name, &lt;attachment&gt;_file_size,
&lt;attachment&gt;_content_type, and &lt;attachment&gt;_updated_at. Only
&lt;attachment&gt;_file_name is required for paperclip to operate. More
information about the options to has_attached_file is available in the
documentation of Paperclip::ClassMethods.
</p>
<p>
Attachments can be validated with Paperclip&#8216;s validation methods,
validates_attachment_presence, validates_attachment_content_type, and
validates_attachment_size.
</p>
<h2>Storage</h2>
<p>
The files that are assigned as attachments are, by default, placed in the
directory specified by the :path option to has_attached_file. By default,
this location is
&quot;:rails_root/public/system/:attachment/:id/:style/:basename.:extension&quot;.
This location was chosen because on standard Capistrano deployments, the
public/system directory is symlinked to the app&#8216;s shared directory,
meaning it will survive between deployments. For example, using that :path,
you may have a file at
</p>
<pre>
  /data/myapp/releases/20081229172410/public/system/avatars/13/small/my_pic.png
</pre>
<p>
NOTE: This is a change from previous versions of Paperclip, but is overall
a safer choice for the defaul file store.
</p>
<p>
You may also choose to store your files using Amazon&#8216;s S3 service.
You can find more information about S3 storage at the description for
Paperclip::Storage::S3.
</p>
<p>
Files on the local filesystem (and in the Rails app&#8216;s public
directory) will be available to the internet at large. If you require
access control, it&#8216;s possible to place your files in a different
location. You will need to change both the :path and :url options in order
to make sure the files are unavailable to the public. Both :path and :url
allow the same set of interpolated variables.
</p>
<h2>Post Processing</h2>
<p>
Paperclip supports an extendible selection of post-processors. When you
define a set of styles for an attachment, by default it is expected that
those &quot;styles&quot; are actually &quot;thumbnails&quot;. However, you
can do more than just thumbnail images. By defining a subclass of
Paperclip::Processor, you can perform any processing you want on the files
that are attached. Any file in your Rails app&#8216;s
lib/paperclip_processors directory is automatically loaded by paperclip,
allowing you to easily define custom processors. You can specify a
processor with the :processors option to has_attached_file:
</p>
<pre>
  has_attached_file :scan, :styles =&gt; { :text =&gt; { :quality =&gt; :better } },
                           :processors =&gt; [:ocr]
</pre>
<p>
This would load the hypothetical class Paperclip::Ocr, which would have the
hash &quot;{ :quality =&gt; :better }&quot; passed to it along with the
uploaded file. For more information about defining processors, see
Paperclip::Processor.
</p>
<p>
The default processor is Paperclip::Thumbnail. For backwards compatability
reasons, you can pass a single geometry string or an array containing a
geometry and a format, which the file will be converted to, like so:
</p>
<pre>
  has_attached_file :avatar, :styles =&gt; { :thumb =&gt; [&quot;32x32#&quot;, :png] }
</pre>
<p>
This will convert the &quot;thumb&quot; style to a 32x32 square in png
format, regardless of what was uploaded. If the format is not specified, it
is kept the same (i.e. jpgs will remain jpgs).
</p>
<p>
Multiple processors can be specified, and they will be invoked in the order
they are defined in the :processors array. Each successive processor will
be given the result of the previous processor&#8216;s execution. All
processors will receive the same parameters, which are what you define in
the :styles hash. For example, assuming we had this definition:
</p>
<pre>
  has_attached_file :scan, :styles =&gt; { :text =&gt; { :quality =&gt; :better } },
                           :processors =&gt; [:rotator, :ocr]
</pre>
<p>
then both the :rotator processor and the :ocr processor would receive the
options &quot;{ :quality =&gt; :better }&quot;. This parameter may not mean
anything to one or more or the processors, and they are free to ignore it.
</p>
<h2>Events</h2>
<p>
Before and after the Post Processing step, Paperclip calls back to the
model with a few callbacks, allowing the model to change or cancel the
processing step. The callbacks are &quot;before_post_process&quot; and
&quot;after_post_process&quot; (which are called before and after the
processing of each attachment), and the attachment-specific
&quot;before_&lt;attachment&gt;_post_process&quot; and
&quot;after_&lt;attachment&gt;_post_process&quot;. The callbacks are
intended to be as close to normal ActiveRecord callbacks as possible, so if
you return false (specifically
</p>
<ul>
<li>returning nil is not the same) in a before_ filter, the post processing
step

</li>
</ul>
<p>
will halt. Returning false in an after_ filter will not halt anything, but
you can access the model and the attachment if necessary.
</p>
<p>
NOTE: Post processing will not even <b>start</b> if the attachment is not
valid according to the validations. Your callbacks (and processors) will
only be called with valid attachments.
</p>
